	"info": "<a href=\"https://zeustracker.abuse.ch\">Abuse.ch Zeus tracker</a>  standard, contains the same data as the ZeuS IP blocklist (zeus_badips)  but with the slight difference that it doesn't exclude hijacked websites (level 2)  and free web hosting providers (level 3) . This means that this blocklist contains all IPv4 addresses associated with ZeuS C&Cs which are currently being tracked by ZeuS Tracker. Hence this blocklist will likely cause some false positives. ",
